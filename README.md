# Excel-Dashboard-Customer-Success-Sales-Dashboard

**DESCRIPTION:**

In this project, I designed and implemented an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Excel to monitor and analyze customer success and sales performance. The dashboard leveraged advanced Excel features such as VBA, formulas, and various chart types to present data in an intuitive and accessible manner.

Key metrics displayed on the dashboard included:

- Sales Trend Over Time: A line chart showing the progression of sales figures over a specified period, allowing for the identification of trends and patterns.
- Quantity of Product Sold Over Time: A bar chart detailing the number of units sold for each product category over time, helping to track product performance.
- On-Time Delivery Percentage vs. Target and Percentage of Returns vs. Target: Gauges and bar charts were used to compare actual performance against targets, providing insights into delivery efficiency and return rates.
- Customer Acquisition: The dashboard featured pie and bar charts illustrating the breakdown of customer acquisition sources, distinguishing between organic and paid searches, as well as returning customers. This information was crucial for understanding the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
- Customer Satisfaction for Different Products: A series of charts highlighted customer satisfaction ratings across various products, helping to identify areas for improvement and enhance product offerings.
- The use of VBA and formulas enabled dynamic data updates and interactive elements, allowing users to filter and explore the data from different angles. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, providing stakeholders with valuable insights for making informed decisions and optimizing customer success strategies. This project resulted in a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding key aspects of sales and customer satisfaction, aiding in the continuous improvement of business performance.
